<p>Here’s a story for you.</p>

<p>Today I reached out to subscribers of my newsletter (feel free to join up under the “Contact” tab, dear reader). The box says something like “I’ll email you once a month,” but here’s the truth: once a month is not the frequency with which I’ve been sending out messages.</p>

<p>In fact, I’ve <em>never</em> sent one out…</p>

<p>…until this morning.</p>

<p>Finally, I felt like I had some really good news to share. I wrote the message, then tried out a few headlines. Most didn’t do much for me. Then I scribbled down something that made me sit up and take notice.</p>

<h3 id="at-last-the-wait-is-over-1">At last, the wait is over.</h3>

<p>Boy, I felt those six words down in the tips of my toes. For context, my previous book <em>Last Girl Gone</em> came out in 2018. I wrote most of that one before I had children, and now somehow they’re five years old. And it sure doesn’t help that I made a lot of embarrassing pronouncements to my publisher about how long it would take me to write a sequel.</p>

<p><em>Six months, no sweat.</em></p>

<p><em>I’m the fastest gun in the west.</em></p>

<p>Ouch. All that to say, this day has been a long time coming. If you’re one of those readers who’s been waiting patiently and faithfully for the past five years for the next installment of the Laura Chambers mysteries, then I owe you a huge thank you. And I owe you a beer. And I owe you a promise that I’ll try to be faster next time. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>I kicked off the book tour last night at Purple Crow Books in Hillsborough, North Carolina–right in the very place this book is set–and I’m happy to report it was a standing room only crowd. What a way to start.</p>
