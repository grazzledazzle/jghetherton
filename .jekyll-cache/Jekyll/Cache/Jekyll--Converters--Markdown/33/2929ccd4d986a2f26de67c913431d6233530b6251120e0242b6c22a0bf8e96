I"ž<p>Hello there! Iâ€™m very excited to share the new cover for WHAT LIES BENEATH. It had a cover previosly that I also thought was fantastic: corn field under a tornado-colored sky. (And if youâ€™re thinking a sky canâ€™t be the color of a tornadoâ€¦youâ€™ve never been near one.) This new cover, though, is fantastic in its own right, and creates a continuity of design between this book and its predecessor and first in the series, LAST GIRL GONE.</p>

<p>Without further ado, may I present to you the cover for WHAT LIES BENEATH:</p>
