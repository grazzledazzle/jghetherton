I"â<p>Hereâ€™s a story for you.</p>

<p>Today I reached out to subscribers of my newsletter (feel free to join up under the â€œContactâ€ tab, dear reader). The box says something like â€œIâ€™ll email you once a month,â€ but hereâ€™s the truth: once a month is not the frequency with which Iâ€™ve been sending out messages.</p>

<p>In fact, Iâ€™ve <em>never</em> sent one outâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦until this morning.</p>

<p>Finally, I felt like I had some really good news to share. I wrote the message, then tried out a few headlines. Most didnâ€™t do much for me. Then I scribbled down a line that made me sit up and take notice.</p>

<p><strong><em>At last, the wait is over.</em></strong></p>

<p>Boy, I felt those six words down in the tips of my toes. For context, my previous book <em>Last Girl Gone</em> came out in 2018. I wrote most of that one before I had children, and now somehow theyâ€™re five years old. And it sure doesnâ€™t help that I made a lot of embarrassing pronouncements to my publisher about how long it would take me to write a sequel.</p>

<p><em>Six months, no sweat.</em></p>

<p><em>Iâ€™m the fastest gun in the west.</em></p>

<p>Ouch. All that to say, this day has been a long time coming. If youâ€™re one of those readers whoâ€™s been waiting patiently and faithfully for the past five years for the next installment of the Laura Chambers mysteries, then I owe you a huge thank you. And I owe you a beer. And I owe you a promise that Iâ€™ll try to be faster next time. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>I kicked off the book tour last night at Purple Crow Books in Hillsborough, North Carolinaâ€“right in the very place this book is setâ€“and Iâ€™m happy to report it was a standing room only crowd. What a way to start.</p>
