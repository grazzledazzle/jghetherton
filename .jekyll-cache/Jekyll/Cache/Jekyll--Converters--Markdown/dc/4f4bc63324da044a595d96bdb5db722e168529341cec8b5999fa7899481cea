I"3<p>This is a test post, the very first post to the “News &amp; Events” section of my new(ish) website. I waffled on calling it new because I did cannibalize a fair few elements from my last website, but there are important differences as well. If you made it all the way here at the bottom of the post pile and are at all curious about the site, here are a few quick facts about me and it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’m curious about but inexperienced with coding, so I decided to make this new site myself as opposed to using a CMS like Wordpress or Squarespace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I built it using Jekyll, a free, open-source static site generator. I also started with a template that I modified for my needs. Thanks to broccolini on Github who created the original template inspired by Swiss design and the works of Massimo Vignelli.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe the best thing about a website built using Jeykll is that Github will host your site for free. One less subscription fee in my life? Yes, please.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
