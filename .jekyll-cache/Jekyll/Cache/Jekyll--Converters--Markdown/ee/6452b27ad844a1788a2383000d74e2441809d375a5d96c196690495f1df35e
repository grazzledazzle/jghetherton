I"'<p>Home at last.</p>

<p>It’s been a blast promoting <em>What Lies Beneath</em> at bookstores and events across North Carolina, but now the tour is over. A huge thank you to everyone who came out to buy a book, or even just to hear me read, and to the bookstores who hosted me along the way.</p>

<p>Special thanks to my co-author Scott Blackburn, and to our esteemed moderator (and one hell of a crime author in his own right) Mr. Eryk Pruitt–together we packed the house at McIntye’s Books and gave them their best sales day of 2022.</p>

<p>Here’s a few shots from life on the road.</p>
