I"‰<p>Dear anyone who happens to be in Hillsborough, North Carolina next week:</p>

<p>Join me for Noir at the Bar at Yonder on King Street. Itâ€™s a great line-up and weâ€™ll have a great time.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re also going to raffle off an advanced reader copy of <em>What Lies Beneath</em> (out in hardcover July 12th, and you can preorder it now anywhere books are sold. <a href="/what-lies-beneath">Check it out here.</a>) plus an audio book version of <em>Last Girl Gone</em>â€¦on CD no less. And yes, Iâ€™ll be throwing in a boombox just to make sure you can listen to it.</p>
