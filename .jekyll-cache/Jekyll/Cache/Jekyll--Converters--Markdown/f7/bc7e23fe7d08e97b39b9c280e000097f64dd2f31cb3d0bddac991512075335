I"©<p>This is a test post to work over the idea of using the category post type to create a category called ‚Äúblog‚Äù that will in turn organize all the blog posts a defined url.</p>

<p>If this works, hell, I‚Äôm almost there.</p>

<p>Next items on the to-do list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figure out a side-by-side layout for the book layout</li>
  <li>create a books (plural) layout to handle the books. Black background?</li>
  <li>Buy button, you can steal from forty jekyll theme I think.</li>
  <li>Look at this great example of a book landing page: https://read.macmillan.com/lp/northwind/</li>
  <li>I like the call to action ‚ÄúREAD NOW‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-end">THE END</h2>
