#My Author Website

Hi, I'm J.G. Hetherton, <i>Audible</i> bestselling author of <i>Last Girl Gone</i>, a <i>Sun-Sentinel</i> Top Debut Mystery of 2018, and <i>What Lies Beneath</i>, nominated for the 2023 Beltie Prize for Best Mystery.

I'm also just a guy with an interest in all kinds of DIY, from gardening to coding. I thought it would be fun to skip paying a professional to make me a website and instead do it myself. To that end, I learned some git and identified Jekyll as a way to generate the sort of static site that makes good author page.

I'm very happy with my progress. I came into the project knowing basically nothing, and now I'm making commits fromt the command line. I'm unstoppable!


This is site is my own modified version of the Swiss Jekyll Theme by Broccolini, which you can see here: https://github.com/broccolini/swiss. Thanks to her and the Jekyll team, I'm truly standing on the shoulders of giants. All errors are of course my own.
