#My Author Website

Hi, I'm **J.G. Hetherton**, *Audible* bestselling author of *Last Girl Gone*, a *Sun-Sentinel* Top Debut Mystery of 2018, and *What Lies Beneath*, nominated for the 2023 Beltie Prize for Best Mystery.

I'm also just a guy with an interest in all kinds of DIY, from gardening to coding. I thought it would be both interesting and cost-efficient to skip paying a professional to make me a website...and instead just do it myself. To that end, I learned some git and identified Jekyll as a way to generate the sort of static site that lends itself to a good author page.

I'm very happy with the progress so far. I came into the project knowing basically nothing, and now I'm making commits from the command line. I'm unstoppable!

This site is my own modified version of the Swiss Jekyll Theme by Broccolini, which you can see here: https://github.com/broccolini/swiss. A big thank you to her and the Jekyll team--I'm truly standing on the shoulders of giants. All errors are of course my own.
