**J.G. Hetherton** was raised in rural Wisconsin, graduated from Northwestern University, and lived in Chicago for the better part of a decade. Along the way to his first novel, he dabbled in many different day jobs before moving to North Carolina for a girl. They live in Durham, North Carolina with their twin daughters, and when heâ€™s not writing, you can find him on the hiking trail or sitting down with a good book.
