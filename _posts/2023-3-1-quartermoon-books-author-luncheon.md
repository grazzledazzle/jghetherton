On Saturday, March 11, I'll be appearing at the Quarter Moon Books annual **Feast of Authors Luncheon** alongside five other great writers: Leah Weiss, Donna Everhart, Heather Bell Adams, Nina de Gramont, and David Dean.

Call the store to secure your ticket, and come out to support one of the great (special, incomparable, magical) North Carolina beach bookstores. See you there.
