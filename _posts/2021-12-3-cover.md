Hello there! I'm very excited to share the new cover for WHAT LIES BENEATH. It had a cover previously that I also thought was great: a corn field under a tornado-colored sky. (And if you're thinking a sky can't be the color of a tornado...you've never been near one.) This new cover, though, is fantastic in its own right, and creates a continuity of design between this book and its predecessor and first in the series, LAST GIRL GONE.


Without further ado, may I present to you the cover for WHAT LIES BENEATH:
