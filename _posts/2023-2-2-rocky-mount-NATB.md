One week from today I'm heading to Rocky Mount, NC to help start a new franchise of everybody's favorite crime fiction series, Noir at the Bar. Come on out and hear from a bunch of great North Carolina authors, including Eryk Pruitt, Natania Barron, Sarah Maragh, and yours truly. Not to mention local Rocky Mount author Robert Creekmore, the evil genius behind this event. Come out and see us, it's going to be a deadly brand of fun.
