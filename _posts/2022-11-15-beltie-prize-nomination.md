I'm very pleased to announce that my book <i>What Lies Beneath</i> has been nominated for the Beltie Prize for Best Mystery of 2023.

For those of you not in the know, McIntyre's Books in Pittsboro, NC is the proud host of what must be the very finest mystery book section in North Carolina, bar none, and of you ever get the chance to visit and check it out, I highly recommend it. They've got an entire room dedicated to great mystery novels, and the commitment and care on display is truly something to behold. If you're a mystery fan, this is your Shangri-La.

So when an institution like that puts out a prize for best mystery of the year? Well, it carries more than a little weight. It's a true honor to have my book be nominated along side a slate of other great candidates. Fingers crossed!
