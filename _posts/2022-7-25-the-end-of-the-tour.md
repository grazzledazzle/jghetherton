Home at last.

It's been a blast promoting *What Lies Beneath* at bookstores and events across North Carolina, but now the tour is over. A huge thank you to everyone who came out to buy a book, or even just to hear me read, and to the bookstores who hosted me along the way.

Special thanks to my co-author Scott Blackburn, and to our esteemed moderator (and one hell of a crime author in his own right) Mr. Eryk Pruitt--together we packed the house at McIntye's Books and gave them their best sales day of 2022.

Here's a few shots from life on the road.
