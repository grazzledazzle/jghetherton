A mystery package was delivered this afternoon. Opened it up, and here's what I found inside:

These advance reader copies look even better than I expected. The cover pops, and it's always a special moment for me to hold a book I wrote in my hand for the very first time. If you're interested, copies may still be available via NetGalley.

*What Lies Beneath* is out in hardcover July 12th, and you can preorder it now anywhere books are sold. [Check it out.]({% link what-lies-beneath.html %})
