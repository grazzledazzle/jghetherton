This is a test post to work over the idea of using the category post type to create a category called "blog" that will in turn organize all the blog posts a defined url.

If this works, hell, I'm almost there.

Next items on the to-do list:

- Figure out a side-by-side layout for the book layout
- create a books (plural) layout to handle the books. Black background?
- Buy button, you can steal from forty jekyll theme I think.
- Look at this great example of a book landing page: https://read.macmillan.com/lp/northwind/
- I like the call to action "READ NOW"

## THE END
