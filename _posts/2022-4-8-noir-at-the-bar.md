Dear anyone who happens to be in Hillsborough, North Carolina next week:

Join me for the next **Noir at the Bar** at Yonder on King Street. It's a great line-up and we'll have a great time.

We're also going to raffle off an advanced reader copy of *What Lies Beneath* (out in hardcover July 12th, and you can preorder it now anywhere books are sold. [Check it out here.]({% link what-lies-beneath.html %})) plus an audio book version of *Last Girl Gone*...on CD no less. And yes, I'll be throwing in a boombox just to make sure you can listen to it.
